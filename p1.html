  <b><font color="red" face="arial" size="5">What is a Programming Language? What is Code?</font> </b></p>
<p><font color="black" face="arial" size="4">The code is pretty much like writing a paragraph of instruction or creating a to-do list to computers. Unlike us humans, the to-do list and instructions you write for the computer has to be extremely detailed and written in some logic.<P>A programming language is a computer language programmers use to develop software programs, scripts, or other sets of instructions for computers to execute.

  Although many languages share similarities, each has its own syntax. Once a programmer learns the languages rules, syntax, and structure, they write the source code in a text editor or IDE. Then, the programmer often compiles the code into machine language that can be understood by the computer. Scripting languages, which do not require a compiler, use an interpreter to execute the script.</P></font>

  <b><font color="red" face="arial" size="5">How to learn a programming language?</font> </b></p>
  <P><font color="black" face="arial" size="4">Learning programming languages primarily requires dedication and practice, you can not become a programmer without writing code. That being said, you can begin to understand Computer Science with an introductory course you like, my recommendation would be Harvard’s CS50 which is publicly available on their youtube channel. After getting familiar with programming and basic concepts, you can pick up the field and language you like and search for resources. You can find hundreds of useful resources, tutorials, and FAQ on Hackr.io concerning many languages and technologies. You’ll also find programming roadmaps for different tracks and blog articles comparing and exploring the different parts of software development.</font></p>

<P><font color="black" face="arial" size="4">Each of the different programming languages mentioned in the next section can be broken into one or more of the following types (paradigms) of languages:-</font></p>
<ul type="square">
    <li>High-level (most common) / low-level</li>
    <li>High-level (most common) / low-level</li>
    <li>General-purpose / domain-specific</li>
    <li>Object-oriented / concurrent</li>
    <li>Command / Compiled / Script language</li>
    <li>Answer set</li>

<p>&#10004;<B><font color="red" face="arial" size="5">Applications and program development:-</font></B></p>
<P><font color="black" face="arial" size="4">Application and program development involves programs you work with on a daily basis. For example, the Internet browser you are using to view this web page is considered a program. If you are interested in developing a program, consider the following languages:-</font></p>
<ul type="square">
    <li>C </li>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>D</li>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>Tcl</li>
    <li>Visual Basic</li>

<b>&#10004;<font color="red" face="arial" size="5">the Uses of a programming language:- </font> </b></p>
  <P><font color="black" face="arial" size="4">Programmers use programming languages to communicate with computers. Many different languages exist, and each one has its own unique features, though they all share some similarities. Because each language is different, each may be best suited for a certain purpose or purposes within certain industries. Some programming languages are used to create programs to solve problems or interpret data. Other programming languages are more suitable for making create software or apps that entertain. With a strong need for unique and diverse programming languages, it is virtually impossible to create a single universal programming language that meets all needs. Programming languages are often revised and even combined with other languages over time, evolving to meet our changing technological needs.
